# weather-dashboard

This weather dashboard project uses the OpenWeather One Call API to retrieve weather data for cities so that the user can search a city by name and view the current weather conditions and a 5 day forecast. The user search history is saved on ```local storage``` so the user can view the weather information again on any city previously saved.
